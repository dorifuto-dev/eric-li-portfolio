# Eric Li's Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- A list of my learning projects.

- Improvements:
  - TDD
  - Hamburger Menu on mobile esp if I add more tabs
  - GraphQL/NodeJS backend with UI to add new entries quickly.
  - ProjectDetail could use improvements
  - General bug fixes
  - UI bug fixes such as distorted background image on portfolio view

- Wins:
  - UI pretty much built out in one day
  - Still got it with React
